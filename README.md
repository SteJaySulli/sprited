# SpritEd

Simple Sprite Editor

## Aims

This project aims to create a multi-platform sprite editor with basic features for editing and animating 2d sprites for simple games.

I am writing this in the hopes it will be useful for my stepson and will help him engage with programming and game design.

**This project is still under development and is not (and may never) be complete - I will remove this notice once it is in a useable state**

## Requirements

If I do complete this project, I hope to release builds for Linux, OS-X and Windows. For now I do not have any builds at all, so you will need to install the following toolchain to get it to work:

* Node v16 or above
* NPM

## Installing

To install the requisite software, use:

```bash
npm install
```

## Running

You can run the program in developer mode with:
```bash
npm run start
```

## Building

To build this, you'll need: 
```bash
npm run build
```
